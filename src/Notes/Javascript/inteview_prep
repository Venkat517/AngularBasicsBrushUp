1) Why JS Is a Dynamic Language?
JS is a dynamic language becoz data types of the variables can be changed during run time.

2) How to dertimes the datatype of a varible in JS?
we can determine by the help of Typeof function
let x = 10;
typeof(x); // number

3) what are the datatypes in the JS?
these can classified into 2 types:-
  1) Primitive data type:
    - string
    - number
    - boolean
    - null
    - undefined
  2) Objects:
    -objects

4) what is undefined datatype?
undefined is nothing but a variable has been defined but there is no value associated with it.

5) What is Null?
null is a data type which is not zero and its not empty but absense of data.

6) what is hoisting?
It is a mechanism where variables and functional declarations are moved to a top during the run time..

var a = 10;
console.log('a,b');
var b = 20;

7) what are global variables?
these are variables that accecible throught out the website or document.

8) What is the use of Strict keyword?
Use of 'Strict' keyword checks if the variable defined using var keyword or not.

9) What is a closure?
In js closure is a feature where inner function has access to outer function's variables and parameters.
  -Scope of access:
    -It has access to its own scope
    -It has access to its outer function variables and parameters
    -It has access to global scope.
    - [real Time]: A boy playing in a park can access to equipment (outer functions), Sun (global), in his own home(own scope).

10) What is function expression?
 When we stored the function in an variable then its called as function expression.
  -eg: let x = () => {
    return 1;
  }
  - Here we are storing function value to a variable x
  // function defination
  eg: console.log(x);

  // function invoking
  eg: console.log(x());

  //** if we are returing nothing from the function then it is executes as undefined.

11) What is IIFE?
here functions will be automatically invoked.

//normal function
-eg: var username = 'sandy';
  function getName(){
    username = 'sandeep';
  };
  getName();
  console.log(username);
  o/p sandeep

//IIFE function
  -eg: var username = 'sandeep';
  let newFun = (() => {
    username = 'sandy';
  })();
  console.log(username);
o/p sandy

12) What is a Spread operator?
it collects several and comprise them.
we use where in a array expression or string when 0 or more arguments are expected.
// Array Spreading.
let arr =[1,3,4,5];
console.log(...arr);
o/p 1 3 4 5

//string Spreading
let str1= 'sandy';
console.log(...str1);
o/p s a n d y

//object Spereading
let perDetails = { name: 'sandy', age: 29}
let profDetails = { occupation: 'UI dev'}
let result = {...perDetails,...profDetails};
o/p age: 29
    name: 'sandy'
    occupation: 'UI dev'

13) what is a rest operator?
in a functions when we require to pass arguments,but not sure of args then we use rest operator.

14) What is Synchronous (or) Single threaded ?
It means that you can only excute one thing at same time. generally JS by default is a Single threaded language.

eg- console.log('sandeep');
console.log('UI developer');

15) What is asynchronous?
It means that you can execute multiple things at same time and you need not be to waite next one to be excutes until current finishes
its task.

eg- console.log('This is one');
    setTimeout(() => console.log('this is second),2000);
    console.log('this is 3rd');

o/p
This is one
This is 3rd
This is second (after 2 sec), because setTimeout is callback which belongs to asynchronous.

15) What is a callback?
- A call back function is passed as a argument to the another function.
- This technique allows function to call another function.
- A call back function can run after another function has finished its task.

eg

function step1(value, callback) {
  callback(value + 10, false);
}

function step2(value, callback) {
  callback(value + 10, false);
}

step1(100, function (res1, err) {
  if (!err) {
    step2(res1, function (res2, err) {
      if (!err) {
        console.log("Results in callback", res2);
      }
    });
  }
});

- To many callbacks results in callback hell. to solve this best way is to use Promises/ (Async/awaite).

//code snippet
fetch('http://api.github.com/users')
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then(result => console.log(result));

16) What is hoisting?
hoisting is a javascript default behavior of moving declarations to the top.

eg: a = 5;
    var a; (valid)

c();
function c() {
  console.log("c");
}
(valid)

b=10;
let b; (invalid)

e=20;
const e; (invalid)
